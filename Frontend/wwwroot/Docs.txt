In wwwroot/css/app.css, the css will look after images in the localhost:8080/css/IMAGE_NAME.
But anywhere else, like if you did a script tag in MainLayout, will just look after localhost:8080/IMAGE_NAME

Bro, downloading a picture is so fucking weird. We literally create a new html a-tag and set the href and download name
to be the image and then appended and click it with javascript.
